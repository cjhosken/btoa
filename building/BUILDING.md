# BUILDING

The Current Build version is Arnold 7.3.4.1




### Linux

On Linux, the build is done in `~/.btoa`.
You will need to edit the `build_linux.sh` if you plan to use different versions of arnold-usd or arnoldSDK.
*Note: For building to work, you will need to get the ArnoldSDK from Autodesk. This needs to be placed in arnoldsdk and you'll need to update the paths accordingly.*
